## Introduction
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This program utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification of malarial cells from microscopic images.

By training a CNN model on a dataset of malarial cell images, the program learns to classify infected and uninfected cells. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, as they can effectively capture spatial features and patterns in the input images.

The program is implemented in Python, leveraging deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. Jupyter Lab provides an interactive environment for running and exploring the program.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Lab
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayub1621/Malarial-Cell_Classification.git
cd Malarial-Cell_Classification
```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. In Jupyter Lab, open the `cnn_classification.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the malarial cell dataset, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate the model's performance.

4. Customize the hyperparameters, network architecture, and training strategy based on your requirements. You can experiment with different CNN architectures, optimizer choices, and data augmentation techniques to improve the classification accuracy.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the program, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance on the test set.

## Results
The program aims to classify malarial cells as infected or uninfected based on the input microscopic images. The accuracy of classification depends on various factors, including the quality and diversity of the training dataset, the architecture of the CNN model, and the effectiveness of the training process.

You can evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, you may consider visualizing misclassified images and exploring techniques to improve the model's performance, such as transfer learning or ensemble methods.
